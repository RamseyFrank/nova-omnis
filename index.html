Here’s what to do next:

1️⃣ Create Your First File (e.g., index.html)
In VS Code, click on Explorer (the file icon on the left) to see your project files.
If there's nothing there yet, create a new file:
Click the New File icon or press Ctrl+N to create a new file.
Name the file index.html (this will be your website’s homepage).
Once you have index.html created, you can start writing some basic HTML:
html
Copy

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Welcome to Nova Omnis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is the start of something amazing!</p>
